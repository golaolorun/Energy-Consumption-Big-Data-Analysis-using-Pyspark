# Energy-Consumption-Big-Data-Analysis-using-Pyspark
## Context
The government is willing to install smart meters in every home to better track energy consumption. This necessitates the collection of data, which must then be processed. It is critical to obtain some fundamental information from the incoming data in order to determine the key patterns in energy usage and make future plans. 
## Objective
Experiment with and understand the incoming data. The data raises a few questions, which are listed in 'spark_notebook.ipynb' file. To find the answers to the questions, the data must be transformed and queried using Pyspark.
## Solution Approach
Create a cluster using data-proc on Google Cloud Platform, then open jupyterlab, and Spark User Interface (see 'solution_architecture.png').
